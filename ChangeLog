	* Moved all the configure.in, Makefile.in etc. up to the top level out
	* of the unix (and win) subdirectories.  These are now shared.
	* If you are using CVS, you'll want to get the "config" module into
	* this directory, or do the checkout of thread again so the config
	* module is brought in.  You should have a "config" subdirectory of
	* your main thread workspace directory.
