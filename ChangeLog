	* Overall changes:
	  (1) Added joinable threads.
	  (2) Added transfer of channels between threads.

	* generic/threadCmd.c: Added functions Thread_Join and
	  ThreadJoinObjCmd.

	  Extended function ThreadCreateObjCmd to handle a
	  -joinable flag.

	  Fixed bug in Thread_Create, the argument 'stacksize' was not
	  used.

	  Removed declaration of ThreadObjCmd, which was not used anywhere
	  else in the code.

	  Added functions Thread_Transfer, ThreadTransferEventProc and
	  ThreadTransferObjCmd. Extended behaviour of ThreadDeleteEvent
	  and ThreadExitProc to deal with the new class of events.

	  Changed usage of ckfree to the more canonical Tcl_Free. Same for
	  ckalloc and Tcl_Alloc.

	* Makefile.in: Fixed bug with regard to the installation of
	  documentation.

	* doc/thread.*: Added documentation of create -joinable,
	  thread::join and thread::transfer.

	* tests/thread.test: Added tests for joining of threads and moving
	  channels between threads.

	* Picked up minor changes from David Gravereaux <davygrvy@bigfoot.com>
	* for compilation on windows with his alternate project files.

2000-04-10  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* Moved all the configure.in, Makefile.in etc. up to the top level out
	* of the unix (and win) subdirectories.  These are now shared.
	* If you are using CVS, you'll want to get the "config" module into
	* this directory, or do the checkout of thread again so the config
	* module is brought in.  You should have a "config" subdirectory of
	* your main thread workspace directory.

	* Updated to compile against 8.3.1 export thread APIs
	* Added Windows makefiles
