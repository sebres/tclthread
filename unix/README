Extension can be compiled on several Unix derivates including various
distributions of Linux. Build process is pretty straightforward. I've
checked various versions of Solaris and Linux but the extension
should compile without problems on any Unix-like operating system
with a proper pthreads library implementation.

To build on Unix-like operating systems, run the CONFIG script:

    % sh CONFIG

That will create a Makefile which you use to run "make" and "make install".
You can use "make clean" to clean the directory from temporary compilation
files and/or "make distclean" to additionaly remove local config files.

You might want to do "make test" before doing the "make install" in order
to run the regression tests on the package.
