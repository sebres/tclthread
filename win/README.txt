Thread extension supports two build scenarios under Windwos:

o. Microsoft MSVC build:
You should use the project and nmake files for the MSVC++ in
the vc/ directory. You'll have to edit those files according 
to the vc/README.txt file.

o. Cygwin/MinGW builds:
Cygwin build is not supported. You should be using the MinGW
to compile the extension. Look in the CONFIG file in this 
directory for more information.
