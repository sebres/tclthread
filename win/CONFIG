# This is how I run configure.  You'll want to change the
# pathnames to match your system, of course

# Remember that if you keep the --enable-sybols, you need to
# use the thread20d.dll in a Tclsh that has also been compiled
# with symbols (e.g., tclsh83d.exe).

# If you want to build both debug and non-debug versions, then
# create "debug" and "release" directories and run configure
# from in those directories with the appropriate flags.

sh ../configure --enable-threads --enable-symbols \
