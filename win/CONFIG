#
# This is how I run configure.  You'll want to change the
# pathnames to match your system, of course.
#
# Remember that if you use the --enable-sybols, you need to
# use the thread24d.dll in a Tclsh that has also been compiled
# with symbols (e.g., tclsh83d.exe).
# If you want to build both debug and non-debug versions, then
# create "debug" and "release" directories and run configure
# from in those directories with the appropriate flags.
#
# Also, only MinGW build for Windows is supported. Cygwin is
# not supported and the configure will throw error if you
# attempt to compile under Cygwin.
# Note the CC=gcc must be set *before* the "configure" is ran.
# This is really needed, otherwise configure will not be able
# to compile the small test file which checks the presence
# of the MinGW build environment. It is not enough to use
# "--enable-gcc" configure option; you *need* to define CC.
# 

export CC=gcc
sh ../configure --enable-threads --with-tcl=d:/tcl8.3.4/win
