# This is how I run configure.  You'll want to change the
# pathnames to match your system, of course
# Remember that if you use the --enable-sybols, you need to
# use the thread24d.dll in a Tclsh that has also been compiled
# with symbols (e.g., tclsh83d.exe).
# If you want to build both debug and non-debug versions, then
# create "debug" and "release" directories and run configure
# from in those directories with the appropriate flags.
# Also, only Mingw build for Windows is supported. Cygwin is
# not supported and the configure will throw error if you
# attempt to compile under Cygwin.
