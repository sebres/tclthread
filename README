WHAT IS THIS ?
==============

This is the source distribution of the Tcl Thread extension. You can use
this extension to gain script-level access to Tcl threading capabilities.
The extension can be used with Tcl cores starting from Tcl8.3 and later.
To get full functionality, though, it is advised to use at least Tcl 8.4
core since it has much better support for threads.

You need to have your Tcl core compiled with "--enable-threds" in order
to turn on internal directives supporting thread-specific details of the
Tcl API. The extension will not load in an Tcl shell built w/o thread
support. 

This extension is a freely available open source package. You can do 
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing
it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the "license.terms"
file in the top-level distribution directory for complete information.


HOW TO COMPILE ?
================

Depending on your platform (Unix-like or Windows) go to the appropriate
directory (unix or win) and start with the README file. 

Extension can be compiled on several Unix derivates including various 
distributions of Linux. Build process is pretty straightforward. I've 
checked various versions of Solaris and Linux but the extension
should compile without problems on any Unix-like operating system 
with a proper pthreads library implementation.

It can also be compiled under Windows using either MinGW environment
(http://www.mingw.org) or Microsoft MSVC++ compiler.
The Cygwin environment (http://www.cygwin.com) may also be used but
the Cygwin-supplied gcc compiler is not supported. You should use
the gcc compiler as provided with the MinGW environment. 
Please note that Cygwin/MinGW builds are working only for Tcl 8.4b1 
or later. Earlier versions of Tcl core had many problems when building
under one of those environments.

There are also some (pretty promising) efforts in using MinGW on Linux
to cross-compile the Tcl core for Windows under Linux operating system.
In general, you might want to take following steps:

  o Install the MinGW cross compiler on Linux. You can the binaries
    from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/mingw-cross.tar.bz2
    You need a Linux with at least gnu libc 2.2 for that.

  o Go to win directory of the tcl8.4b1 source distribution.

  o Create the "config.site" file with the following contents:
   
    CC=mingw32-gcc
    AR=mingw32-ar
    RANLIB=mingw32-ranlib
    RC=mingw32-windres

  o Run "CONFIG_SITE=config.site ./configure"
  o Run "make"

After some (noisy) warnings you will get a set of *.exe and *.dll
files you can transfer to a Windows machine. Don't forget to copy
Tcl libraries as well, otherwise Tcl shell won't start correctly.
Repeat steps above for building the Threading extension as well.


WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION ?
============================

Documentation in Unix man and standard HTML format is available in the
doc/man and doc/html directories respectively. 
Currently, documentation is in reference-style only. The tutorial-style
documentation will be provided with future releases of the extension.


HOW TO GET SUPPORT ?
====================

The extension is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely by the Tcl
community. The home for sources and bug/patch database is on SourceForge:

        http://tcl.sourceforge.net/

Alternatively, you are always welcome to post your questions, problems
and/or suggestions relating the extension (or any other Tcl issue)
to news:comp.lang.tcl newsgroup.
