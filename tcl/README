Software here is provided as example of making some interesting things
and applications using the Tcl threading extension.

Currently, following packages are supplied:

   tpool/    Example Tcl-only implementation of thread pools.
             The threading extension includes the efficient
             threadpool implementation in C. This file is 
             provided as a fully functional example how this
             functionality may be implemented in Tcl alone.

   phttpd/   MT-enabled httpd server. It uses the threadpool
             capability and distributes incoming requests among
             several worker threads in the threadpool. This way
             blocking requests may be handled much better, w/o
             halting the event loop of the main responder thread.
             In this directory you will also find the uhttpd file.
             This is the same variant but operating in event-loop
             mode alone, no threads. Good for comparison purposes.

   cmdsrv/   Socket command-line server. Each new connection gets
             new thread thus allowing multiple outstanding blocking
             calls w/o halting the event loop.

To use them, change to the corresponding directory and source files
in the Tcl8.4 (or later) Tcl shell. Be sure to have the latest Tcl
threading extension installed in your package path.
